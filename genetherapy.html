                    <p>In December 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two groundbreaking gene therapies for sickle cell disease: exagamglogene autotemcel and lovotibeglogene autotemcel. If you're considering these new treatment options, you may have questions. Below, we provide key information to help you understand gene therapy and its implications.</p>
                    
                    <div class="therapy-highlight">
                        <p>These innovative treatments represent the most significant advancement in sickle cell disease treatment in decades, offering potential freedom from painful crises and other complications.</p>

                            <p>Gene therapy is considered a potentially curative treatment—but more long-term research is needed to confirm lifelong effectiveness. Studies show a significant reduction in pain episodes, yet the FDA currently requires 15 years of patient follow-up after treatment.</p>
                            <p>While the results so far are promising, scientists are cautiously optimistic as they continue to monitor patients for lasting effects and any potential long-term complications.</p>

                                <h3>Track Your Triggers</h3>
                                <p>Keep a journal of what may lead to a crisis (e.g., stress, cold, dehydration). Identifying patterns can help prevent future episodes.</p>

                                <p>Heating pads or warm baths may ease pain in joints or muscles. Be careful not to burn your skin and limit sessions to 20 minutes.</p>

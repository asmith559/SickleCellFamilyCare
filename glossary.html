                        <dt>Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS)</dt>
                        <dd>A serious and potentially life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease. It occurs when sickled cells block blood vessels in the lungs, leading to symptoms such as chest pain, fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. ACS is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in people with SCD.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Anemia</dt>
                        <dd>A condition in which the body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to tissues. In sickle cell disease, anemia is chronic and caused by the rapid breakdown of sickled red blood cells.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Blood Transfusion</dt>
                        <dd>A medical procedure in which healthy red blood cells from a donor are given to someone with sickle cell disease. Transfusions can help treat severe anemia, prevent complications like stroke, and increase oxygen delivery in the body.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)</dt>
                        <dd>Also called a stem cell transplant, BMT is a potential cure for sickle cell disease. It involves replacing diseased bone marrow with healthy marrow from a matched donor. This allows the body to produce normal red blood cells.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Chronic Complications</dt>
                        <dd>Long-term health problems caused by ongoing damage from sickle cell disease. These may include organ failure, joint and bone problems, kidney disease, eye damage, and delayed growth or puberty in children.</dd>

                        <dt>Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF)</dt>
                        <dd>A type of hemoglobin that babies are born with. It is more effective at carrying oxygen and does not sickle. Increasing levels of fetal hemoglobin in people with SCD can reduce symptoms and complications.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Folic Acid</dt>
                        <dd>A B-vitamin recommended for individuals with sickle cell disease. It helps the body produce new red blood cells, which is especially important because red cells break down more quickly in people with SCD.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Gene Therapy</dt>
                        <dd>A treatment approach that modifies a person's own stem cells to correct the sickle cell mutation or boost protective genes. It is a new and potentially curative option, with ongoing long-term research to determine its full safety and effectiveness.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Hemoglobin</dt>
                        <dd>A protein found in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. In SCD, abnormal hemoglobin (Hemoglobin S) causes red cells to sickle and block blood flow.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Hemoglobin S (HbS)</dt>
                        <dd>The abnormal form of hemoglobin that causes sickle cell disease. When oxygen levels are low, HbS causes red blood cells to become stiff, sticky, and shaped like crescents or sickles.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Hemolysis</dt>
                        <dd>The destruction or breakdown of red blood cells. In SCD, red blood cells break down faster than normal (in about 10–20 days instead of 120), leading to chronic anemia and other complications.</dd>

                        <dd>An oral medication used to treat sickle cell disease. It increases fetal hemoglobin production, which helps reduce the frequency of pain episodes, acute chest syndrome, and the need for transfusions.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Infertility</dt>
                        <dd>A possible long-term side effect of certain treatments for sickle cell disease, such as chemotherapy used in bone marrow or gene therapy. It refers to the inability to have children naturally.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Jaundice</dt>
                        <dd>A condition marked by yellowing of the skin and eyes. It results from the buildup of bilirubin, a substance produced when red blood cells break down. Jaundice is common in people with SCD due to increased hemolysis.</dd>

                        <dd>A common and painful episode in sickle cell disease caused by sickled red blood cells blocking blood flow in small vessels. Pain can occur anywhere in the body and may require hospitalization for management.</dd>

                        <dt>Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)</dt>
                        <dd>A group of inherited blood disorders where red blood cells become misshapen (sickle-shaped), stick to blood vessel walls, and block blood flow. This leads to pain, organ damage, and other serious health issues.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>Sickle Cell Trait (SCT)</dt>
                        <dd>A condition where a person inherits one sickle cell gene and one normal gene. People with SCT usually don't have symptoms but can pass the sickle cell gene to their children.</dd>
